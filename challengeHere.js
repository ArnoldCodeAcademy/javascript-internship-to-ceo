/* EXPLANATION

  You need to print out ten numbers to the console prompt.

  A `for-loop` is the perfect tool for this job!

  You create a loop with a running index of `i` with the starting value of `1`.

  The loop will stop once `i` reaches the value of `11`, so when `i` equals `10`, the loop will execute the last time because you created the condition of    `i <= 10`.

  The running index will be increased by `1` every iteration. `i++` is the corresponding statement for that. It is the short form for `i = i+1`.

  Inside the loop you got your statement of `console.log(i);` which prints out, whatever is inside the brace, to the console window.
